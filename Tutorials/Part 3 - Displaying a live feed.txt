Before we begin I should probably tell you how to run your programs and stuff. I recommend that you
do not use IDLE, the Python IDE that comes along with it because it sometiems causes problems
while running SimpleCV programs. So you need to write them separately and run them manually.

Use Notepad++ for writing the programs. Get it at http://notepad-plus-plus.org/download/v6.7.2.html
Click the first link (the one which says take this one if you have no idea which to take)
Download it, install it and pin it to the taskbar (will come in handy, trust me)

To write a python program, create a new blank page (Ctrl + N) and save as (Ctrl + Alt + S)
Save it as filename.py since it's a python file. Do all this before you write any code since python
syntax is automatically highlighted (useful right?) when you save it as a .py file.

So our first program is "live.py". Let's go through it line by line.
Open the program in notepad++ and click on File > Open Containing folder > cmd
Then run the program with the command "python live.py" (without the quotes)
Press ESC to end the program.
To run any other python program type "python filename.py" (without the quotes)

Note - A lot of this program is going to be reused in the coming tutorials so please try to
understand this part fully since I won't be repeating myself.

------------------------------  line 1 - "from SimpleCV import *" ---------------------------------

As you may be aware, SimpleCV is a collection of python classes and modules which make computer
vision easy. A lot of their code involves writing classes to represent objects such as
an image, a camera, a display etc in order to simplify coding. This first line basically tells
python that we want to make use of all the programs and classes that are part of the SimpleCV
library (even though we aren't going to make use of all of them). Some of the more important
classes that we import are Image, Camera, Display, Color etc. So in order to use the SimpleCV
library, we need to import everything from it.

If you are unfamiliar with classes and objects please look at the following links

------------------ line 3 - "cam = Camera(0, {"width" : 320, "height" : 240})" --------------------

This part is about the creation of a camera object. Lets break it up into little pieces.
The 0 and the width and the height are all properties of the camera object which have to be 
initialized by the Camera() constructor. So what's that 0 there? Well it's the index of your camera
which starts from 0. If you have multiple cameras connected to your system, each one will have a 
different index. So if you'd write 1 instead of 0, it would refer to the second camera plugged
into your system. It does not have to be specified if there's only one camera since it's default
value is 0. 

The next part of the camera constructor is a dictionary of properties such as height and width
It's pretty clear from the code that we are trying to set up a camera which captures images
of height 240 pixels and width 320 pixels. Note that the default resolution is 640 x 480 but
there is some glitch in my system which doesn't allow me to use that resolution so I have to
explicitly set it to a lower resolution. Writing "cam = Camera()" is therefore equivalent to
writing "cam = Camera(0, {"width" : 640, "height" : 480})" If you ever get an error which says
ERROR : SampleCB() (yeah I spelt that right) - buffer sizes do not match
just lower the resolution to 320 x 240 and it should work fine.

For more details, check out the documentation at
http://simplecv.org/docs/SimpleCV.html#i/SimpleCV.Camera.Camera

------------------------------- line 5 - "display = Display()" ------------------------------------

As you can see from the code, this is the creation of a display object. Why do we need a display
object? Well a display object represents the window on which we output our final images.
This display object is also resonsible for handling mouseclick events as we will see later
and also detects when the window has been closed. The size of the display window generally scales
to fit the size of the image being displayed but this can be changed however. One use of the
display object is shown in the next line.

For more details, check out the documentation at
http://simplecv.org/docs/SimpleCV.html#i/SimpleCV.Display.Display

---------------------------- line 7 - "while not display.isDone():" -------------------------------

Perhaps I should have mentioned what the goal of this program is. As you must have guessed, all we
are doing is continuously capturing frames from the camera, flipping them horizontally and then
displaying them. To do this continuously, we have to loop the part where we grab a frame, flip it
and then display it. But how do we know when to stop? That's where the display object comes in use.
We can use it to check whether the window has been closed or not. The window will be closed if you
click the red button with the X to close it (like a normal window) or if you press the ESC key.
These two phenomena are called events. Moving the mouse around is also an event. The display object
can check for these events and do stuff accordingly. Take for example the "isDone()" function.
What is does is return either True or False depending on the state of the window. If the window
is active, it returns True but if the close button has been clicked or the ESC key has been pressed
then it returns True. So we can use this function in our while loop to continuously check if the
window has been closed or not. Note the use of the "not" keyword here. We want the loop to keep 
going as long as the isDOne() fucntion returns False so we use "not" to negate that. Once the
isDone() function returns True, negating that makes it False and so the loop terminates.

Note - If you are using a display object, never use a loop like "while True:" You can't stop the
program with Ctrl + C unlike other infinite loops and you will be in trouble.

------------------------------ line 9 - "img = cam.getImage()" ------------------------------------

Remember that camera object called cam that we had created earlier? Well here's where we use it.
It has a nice function called "getImage()" that returns an Image object. So the image that we
capture with the "getImage()" function is stored in the variable called img. Storing this value
as an Image object allows us to use all the functions of the Image class on it as we will see

-------------------------- line 11 - "flipped_img = img.flipHorizontal()" -------------------------

Now that we have an Image object, there is a lot of stuff that we can do with it. This line shows
how to flip an image using the "flipHorizontal()" function. There are many other functions which 
operate on Image objects and you can take a look at them here
http://simplecv.org/docs/SimpleCV.html#i/SimpleCV.ImageClass.Image

The key here is to understand that most of these functions RETURN ANOTHER IMAGE object. So syntax
like "img_flipped = img.flipHorizontal().flipVertical().flipHorizontal().flipVertical()"
is perferctly valid syntax since the output of one operation is the input for the next. In fact, 
this series of operations actually returns the exact same image :P

--------------------------------- line 13 - "flipped_img.show()" ----------------------------------

The show function is one of the most important functions here. It basically displays the image on
the window created by the display object earlier. This is one of the few Image class fucntions that
does not return any value and so it does not to be stored in a variable.

Note that the previous 3 lines of code could easily have been replaced by
"cam.getImage().flipHorizontal().show()"
Keep this in mind since we will be using this quite often later on.
